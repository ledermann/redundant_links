RedundantLinks
==============

Automatic creation of redundant links to multiple associations.


Example
=======

class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :orders
  has_many :notes, :as => :object
end

class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :contact
  has_many :notes, :as => :object
end

class Note < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :object, :polymorphic => true
  
  has_redundant_links Note => :object, Order => :contact, Contact => nil
end

Now you can do:

Contact.find(123).redundant_linked_notes
=> notes directly linked to comments AND linked to orders of this contact
